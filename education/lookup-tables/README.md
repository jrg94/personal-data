# Lookup Tables

## Courses

The purpose of the [course lookup](course-lookup.csv) table is to provide
additional information about each of the courses I teach or have taught.
The file is setup to be expanded if needed. For now, the headers are as
follows:

- **Course ID**: a unique identifier for that particular course (e.g., 1)
- **Course Department**: the department that houses that course (e.g., CSE)
- **Course Number**: the department-specific code for that course (e.g., 2221)
- **Course Name**: the official name of the course (e.g., Software Components)

## Sections

The purpose of the [teaching history](teaching-history.csv) file is
to record the courses I've taught over the years. It's also meant
to be a bit of a lookup table for other files, since each class
has a unique ID. The list below details the headers:

- **Section ID**: a unique identifier for that particular course section (e.g., 7382)
- **Year**: the year the course was taught (e.g., 2023, 2024, etc.)
- **Season**: the season in the academic year the course was taught (e.g., Spring, Autumn, Summer)
- **Department**: the department the course is hosted in
- **Course Number**: the department-specific course code
- **Course Type**: the university designated label for the section ID (e.g., Lecture, Lab, etc.)
- **Start Time**: the time class starts for the course in 24-hour time
- **End Time**: the time class ends for the course in 24-hour time
- **Building**: the campus building that takes place as a two character code
- **Room Number**: the number of the room in the building where the course is taught
- **Job Title**: the position I held during that semester (e.g., Graduate Teaching Associate, Lecturer, etc.)
- **Role**: the specific role I held during that course (e.g., Instructor of Record, Grader, etc.)
