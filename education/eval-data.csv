I especially liked the labs because it was clear that they were for our purpose mostly. What we put in to the lab is what we would get out of it every week. I used them as an opportunity to learn that content and get to work directly with the TA which I appreciated.","My biggest problem with this course were the exams and grade distribution. I am not a computer science major but I learned MatLab and C++ in my honors engineering course my freshman year, and we had online exams in that class which I felt were more fair. To me, coding is about problem solving. When actual coders work, I am sure they make mistakes all the time. On projects and labs I messed up countless times, but I think there is great value to be a coder that knows how to find and solve errors. When our exams are written and it is expected we can physically write code correctly the first time, I just think it isn't representative of what coding is supposed to be. Additionally, weighting the exams incredibly heavily was kind of ridiculous. In my opinion, I think there is much more value in completing projects and labs. To me, this is more representative of the field we are studying. Exams being worth 70% in a coding class just doesn't make sense to me. Additionally, some of the homeworks were very tedious and long, especially as the semester went on. They simply got to the point where it wasn't worth my time to complete such lengthy assignments with my whole attention if they were only worth 4% of our grade. 
TL;DR: I think that this course could use a change of examination policy and definitely a change in grade weight distribution to become a more fair and representative of coding.","Interest","I was really amazed at how well you taught considering it was your first semester. While it obviously isn't easy to get a classroom to participate all the time, you never failed to encourage us to think independently and be involved in your lectures. You always had the best interest of the students at the forefront of your priorities and I think we all appreciated that. You tried your best to simplify the somewhat complex and confusing nature of this course and I was appreciative of that. Personally, I am a biomedical engineering student planning to go into the medical field after graduation, so coding most likely won't be a big part of my life in the future. However, I always appreciated when you discussed real world examples from your career and academic studies. Also, while it didn't always interest me personally, I thought it was cool when you would get into more detail than the course allotted with certain aspects of the class. In the future though, I think it might be worth considering saving those types of discussions until later in the semester to avoid confusing students. In general, if teaching is what you are planning on doing in life, then I think Ohio State is very lucky to have you. Best of luck with getting your PhD.","","Jeremy Grifski"

Oftentimes, some solutions are intuitive yet takes more lines of code, while the relatively more efficient solutions require the programmer thinking in a higher level. From my personal experience, this is really helpful to students' learning, since we are able to better understand how to link human thinking with computer ""thinking"". 

Practically, a program to determine whether a given integer n is a prime number may be a good example. In this case, an intuitive way may start with declaring a boolean type ""true"", and then use ""and"" logic to link the previous boolean with n % i == 0 within a while loop. This solution constructs a general idea of how to use while loop for students. On the other hand, Dr. Grifski later shown us another way without using boolean type: while n wholly divides i, we let i ++; and if i adds up to n, the number is prime. The second solution may take a minute to think, but it indeed reveals the essence of the problem determining whether n is a prime number, both mathematically and ""programmingly"". This solution, besides its efficiency, shows me another high level idea of the use of while loop, sort of like finding the ""range"" of some condition, instead of simply doing something while satisfies the condition. I learnt a lot thanks to this method, as well as other similar methods Dr. Grifski taught us.","","Jeremy Grifski"

In my opinion, the midterms, which required minimal studying in order to receive a good grade, gave the illusion that the final was going to follow the same kind of difficulty. This was definitely not the case, and I would have felt more prepared if the final exam review had covered much more difficult questions. The review featured questions that I thought were very easy to figure out, but were not the types of questions I faced on the final.

Also, I really liked the practice midterm on the CSE website. I think more practice worksheets and practice tests would be very helpful.","Degree requirement","For the most part, I enjoyed your style of teaching. You seemed very passionate about helping students which made it easier for me to talk to you about questions I had on projects and homework. However, I do have two criticisms.

Firstly, I would have liked to see final exam review questions that better reflected the difficulty of the exam. Personally, I felt that the final would be just as easy as the midterms (though others may have potentially found them difficult, I felt that they were very easy). I think more thorough preparation for the final and a greater emphasis on it being very difficult would have helped, although admittedly, it is entirely my responsibility to gauge the exam and study as I see fit. Still, I would have liked the review to be more difficult.

Secondly, I wasn't the biggest fan of the ""Assigning Experts"" activities. In my opinion, I think that assigning students to learn the lesson of the day themselves defeats the entire purpose of a lecture. This was especially true during days entirely devoted to learning a specific data structure (Stack, Map, etc.). There were many times where I wondered if I could have simply skipped the Assigning Experts activities and simply learned the data structures from the slides and OSU CSE components library from my own dorm. Personally I felt that a lot of learning data structures was independent work, and relied a lot on the components library. I think it would be better to use the time spent on Assigning Experts activities to expand upon information already established in the components libraries, similar to the labs.

Other than that, I really enjoyed your teaching. You made it very clear that you were passionate about your students and wanted to give them the best chance at success in your class, you were also very helpful and open to questions.","",""
