2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Best professor I have had at OSU"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Jeremy is"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Probably one of the best Software I instructors."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Great professor and always interesting in helping students."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Jeremy is an excellent professor who truly gives students the flexibility necessary to excel in these degree paths"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Best teacher I've ever had in one of the hardest classes I've had to take so far. Fantastic job."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"I love Prof. Grifski. He is a positive, friendly, and helpful instructor. He goes above and beyond to help students outside of class and accommodates everyone's needs. I am happy with my grade, but if I were to receive an F in this course, it would be because of a lack of effort on my part, because Prof. Grifski gives you all of the resources, office hours, help, and second chances to succeed in his class. I actually failed my first coding course at OSU, so I didn't feel confident at the beginning of Software I. I was so distressed that I used to cry thinking about that class and taking more programming classes, but because of the relaxed and supportive class environment, I feel a lot better in Software I. The online class Discord makes it much easier for us to contact the TA's, graders, and the prof outside of class. I also noticed that the professor encourages us before and after the midterms so we feel don't feel too bad about receiving a low score. He makes his own slides, collects data about all our assignments, attendance, grades, etc. and shares it with us so that we know what to expect for this course. He has a blog and writes articles that are helpful and relevant to the class concepts and assignments. It's also notable that Prof. Grifski is open in communicating his opinions on the course content and structure, and gives us advice on which labs/topics are important. It allows for students to share their concerns and frustrations in a healthy way with the instructor, who seems to value student feedback. I would say that this instructor made a learning environment that allowed us to succeed and improve our programming skills and boost our confidence. I feel happy to be in his class, and all of the classmates I have talked with have also expressed positive experiences with Prof. Grifski."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"He really cares about helping his students"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Jeremy is easily one of the best professors I have ever had he is always willing to help and wants his students to pass his class. I think this is a hard class with outdated material but he made it interesting and relatable and I think he should universally teach this class."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Best instructor I've ever had."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"Best instructor i've ever had. And i mean that genuinely.

2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6582,Lecture,"This course is a weird one where some students just get it and others don't. As someone who got it I felt like the course was a bit slow and uninteresting but I could clearly tell that the instructor wanted to make certain that everyone was set up to succeed."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Jeremy is a great instructor and a great person. He always made class interesting and encouraged students to network and get to know each other. Jeremy was always very understanding and flexible. He genuinely cares about his students. Overall, he was a great instructor and I was lucky to have class with him!"

2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"The best professor I've had in five years. Was actively helpful and proactive in addressing potential confusing parts of topics and taught topics in a way that made them easy to understand and apply in homework/assignments."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"The most caring and helpful professor I have had thus far"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Jeremy is the best professor I've had so far at Ohio State. He really cares about the students and makes sure we actually learn, not just memorize for a test and then forget."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"None"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Arguably the best instructor I've ever had. Super helpful and always available and willing to meet. I truly feel like Jeremy was one of the main reasons I was able to be successful in this course."

2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Jeremy Grifski is probably one of the best professors I ever had."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Jeremy was a great professor and he was always very helpful whenever I had questions. I especially like how he uses discord as a 'hub' for this class, and it made it very easy to ask questions and just bounce ideas off other students. It was also helpful because I could see what other students had asked and how they were able to solve their problems."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Best professor I've ever had, one of the greatest teachers I've ever had, should have a full time teaching position, probably should be head of the department. This guy knows what he's talking about and he really cares about the students. Best professor."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Jeremy was great, he cares so much about his students and is just as frustrated with how the class is set up as we are"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"I would certainly say I lucked out with having Jeremy as my professor for Software 1. The class is notorious for its difficulty and arguable unfairness, yet he somehow manages to make sure that all students in his class are given the right tools to succeed all while answering every little question people may have. The course is inherently poorly organized in my opinion since a lot of the content is very outdated and the grading is particularly harsh, but that is no fault of the instructor. Seriously a great classroom experience."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Jeremy explains concepts really clearly, would definitely take his course again!"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Jeremy is one of the best instructors/teachers I've ever had. He motivates me to pursue computer science and programming. He has managed to make a course that is notably very bad, something a little more enjoyable."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Best professor"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Super easy to talk to, fast response time, knowledgeable and understanding, fun to learn from."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"The course itself leaves a lot to be desired; it is extremely work heavy, overly challenging, outdated, and poorly organized, but Jeremy did an excellent job at making sure we got the most out of the class and offered plenty of support for us."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"I struggled with this class and it's material but he was always very interested in helping me and making sure I could understand the material as much as I could. He also was very understanding about outside conflicts and was always welcoming so that I could ask as many questions as I wanted"
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Jeremy was always willing to help out his students and created an environment where students were comfortable with asking questions."
2023,Spring,CSE 2221,6580,Lecture,"Best teacher I've had, very helpful and easy to relate with."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Did a great job!"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Professor Grifsky was honestly one of the best professors I have ever met. He is such an open, relatable, approachable, understanding, and caring guy. On the first day of class, I could immediately tell that he was not going to be like your average professor. He does so much and puts so much effort into making sure that he is doing what's best for his students. I am thankful that I had the pleasure of being one of his students this semester."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Great teacher with a caring attitude and wealth of knowledge."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Best course this year"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"The best instructor I have ever had so far at OSU and I'm a second year. He genuinely wants to help the students in his class succeed and always goes the extra mile. Used a discord to communicate with the class which was an absolutely amazing idea as it served everyone so amazingly. Always finds a way to keep the material interesting and humorous while making sure everyone understands. I would recommend Dr. Grifski to anyone interested in taking CSE 2221."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Mr. Gifski is really patience and he will answer almost every question we asked. He can explain all the concept every well and I think he trid his best to help each of us with ur projects ."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"In my 4 years of college, I have never had an instructor like Jeremy Grifski. From the first day of class I left knowing that this course was going to be challenging but I was so thankful he was assigned to my section. I've never experienced a professor who I felt genuinely cared about each and every student. While I've been told by many professors 'I care about all of you' Jeremy actually showed it. We all know he has his hands full, being in school himself while teaching 2 sections but you would never know it. Anytime you ask him for anything he makes sure he is intentional with providing specifically what you need. On top of that, he created one, if not the best learning environments I've ever been in. No one was afraid to speak up, give input or ask questions. He challenged and succeeded in getting us students to engage with each other, which is very hard in a world that is so socially distant. But most importantly he built a trust bond with us and we built one with him. We student really trusted that he was going to prepare us for not just the projects and tests in the class but the real world as well. After each assignment and test, we saw that this guy isn't lying to us. He's genuinely preparing us for everything he says he will and it makes it so much easier to listen, engage and learn from someone like that. He asked us today in class 'What's one thing in 5 years from now that you'll take with you from this class?' While he was referring to specific material taught all I could think about was how amazing his teaching and was, how I felt like I had a teacher in my corner rooting for me and not trying to play tricks and reach for a standardized bell curve. I'm not kidding, I would take this course over again just because of how much I loved being in his class and from my conversations with others taking the same course with a different instructor, they can't say the same. Jeremy should be a leading example to any and all college professors of how to create a positive, healthy and successful learning environment."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Mr. Grifski is awesome, and I consider him to be one of the best professors I've had so far here at Ohio State. You can tell he loves teaching, and he's always available to help students when needed. He's also quite clearly an expert with the course material and really knows what he's doing. 10/10."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Jeremy Grifski is a kind and helpful professor.He create a discord channel so that students can ask question via it instead of email. In fact, from my experience of this semester, the discord channel is more helpful than email. When I asked problem on discord, someone on class would answer it immediately."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"More practice problems for the course material would be good. ones that include actual programming in eclipse."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Gem of a human being."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Although the class structure is a bit outdated and frustrating, this teacher made it as accommodating as possible for his students, made me feel not afraid to ask questions or get things wrong, overall very supportive and communicated frequently and effectively with the class"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"One of my favorite CSE professors. Went above and beyond to make sure students had what they needed to excel."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"The best professor in CSE, period. he teaches the class in his own way and explains the complicated concepts in the relatively easier way so the students would understand them better. also, he is very responsive when you ask him questions on the discord chat, so you get the help you need for your projects, homework, or exam prep in a timely manner. thanks Jeremy!"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"he method of explaining topics are clear and easily understood and if someone needed more input on the matter he made it his mission to help that student."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,37465,Lecture,"Office hours with him were really helpful"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"The best instructor you can get in such a tough course, and probably my favorite instructor on campus."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy does a great job helping us and getting us through the difficult learning curve of programming. He's extremely patient and positive, and it seems like he has a genuine interest in everyone's success."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy is probably the best professor I've had so far."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"He was always attentive to students needs during class and lab and always eager to answer students questions"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Good class"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"He was patient with work and understanding. He helped walk us through the content very easily. He deserves a raise tbh."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Best teacher I have had in college. Wish I could have Jeremy for software 2 and beyond."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"The instructor included tips that could be used in the workspace and included a free to think space where students felt comfortable."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy Grifski is the best professor I've ever had in school. He creates the best environment for learning and is the most understanding person as well. I wish all professors were like him."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"He was the best professor I've ever had and he truly cared about us as people"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"He provided many resources for us. He even had his own website with great information."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy did a wonderful job teaching this class. Software I is a very hard class but I think it is a result of the course director and the content he comes up with. Jeremy knows that the class is meant to be hard and explains the test is designed to make us fail. As a result, he tries to help us out as much as possible. He is always willing to work extra with us to make sure we understand it. He is available outside of class to contact him and get help. Overall, Jeremy is a good teacher, but the class is awful and I wouldn't want to take it again due to the class structure."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"I found Jeremy to be an engaging and helpful instructor. The course is organized very well and Jeremy was incredibly easy to approach."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy is a very good professor who wants to see his students succeed"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"The discord chat was a simple but extremely helpful tool in finding advice and assistance on the assignments. Being flexible with due dates was a huge help and took off stress when there were other things to be completed."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"GOAT"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy Grifski is an excelent instructor who clearly has a passion for teaching students. He genuinely cares about students succeeding and is very open and honest about everything."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Incredible instructor, made a real effort to engage students in the material and created a very safe learning environment."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy is the first teacher I've met that I know 100% is on my side. He wants his students to succeed, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen. Great guy, great teacher."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"I couldn't have asked for a better lecturer for Software I. Was super helpful and willing to reach out to student both in and out of class. His more straightforward approach teaching definitely helped me and many others in this class."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Best professor"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy is an excellent instructor. He really cares about his students."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Amazing, best teacher I have ever had. Very personable and funny, but also very smart and understands the material very well. I wish he could teach every one of my comp sci classes. Thanks Jeremy!"
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Was interested in teaching, wasn't afraid to say course could be better, tried to help students. Cared about students."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"By far one the best instuctors I've had at Ohio State. The actual course content of CSE 2221 can be mixed at times, but Grifski still manages to make it consistently interesting. His passion for helping students both in and outside the classroom elevates his class far above what it needs to be. As someone who wishes to pursue higher level education, I'm taking Grifski's class as a shining example of what an instructor is capable of."
2022,Spring,CSE 2221,25427,Lecture,"Jeremy created an excellent environment in the classroom and for online learning. I liked the amount of freedom we had throughout the semester, but I also appreciated the tips he gave us. Overall, I really liked having him for this class."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"He did a great job teaching us the content, in a stimulating way for every student."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"This class was amazing! I really hope you consider taking more courses! The education sector needs more instructors like you!"
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"He took the class itself, which isn't structured the best, and made it into something compelling and exciting to learn about. Calls out a lot of bs in the CSE department, which I appreciate. I love a teacher that knows the flaws in something and still tries to make the best out of it. Would definitely recommend him."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Jeremy was the best instructor/teacher I've had in my entire life. He's awesome!"
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Really wish he could teach all of my CSE classes. You could tell he is passionate about the material."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"He was aware of the shortcomings in the course material itself and specifically planned around it while also listening to student feedback"
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"I hate how this course is organized and taught like it's the 1990s, but Jeremy was a great instructor and gave us all of the information we needed to know. Hands down best instructor I’ve had so far in college. He also takes time outside of class to make sure his students understand the content and is understanding about adjusting deadlines as needed. I felt well prepared for every exam and project. Keep it up Jeremy!!"
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Great instructor! I learned a lot from Professor Grifski."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"He was a very good professor. Went out of his way to improve the course material as he viewed it as inadequate in some areas."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Jeremy Grifski was an amazing teacher. One of, if not the best, instructors I've ever had. He was absolutely fantastic and was always open to any questions. He was also always really understanding of any unlucky circumstances that may happen to students and always was flexible in accommodating. He also always make time for his students, especially outside of class."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"i love u jeremy, thank you so much for being a great teacher. the class was really nice and it's obvious that you really care about your students."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Grifiki is a kind person who really cares for his students. He is enthusitic of teaching and try to let his students to engage. He always stay at lab and answer a lot of questions of his students. All in all, he is a great professor."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Thank you so much for the great class! You are the most awesome instructor I've ever had!"
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"The interactive lecture—style was helpful"
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Passionate instructor"
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Great instructor"
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"You did a great job this semester teaching us. The only thing I would change about the class I would change is instead of going through slides with the most basic examples of methods for all the Osu components like natural number, I would go through those more quickly and then show real examples of code with multiple methods from natural number, sequence, or whatever component you are teaching in eclipse or something like that and show editing the code in real time and what it does to end result by changing variables or lines of code. In this course we really don’t see any examples of real code that's not just the simplest examples of methods separate from each other besides our own code that we create for the most part on our own. For me, who is someone with little to no coding experience before this class (zero coding in high school and I didn't even know what I didn't know in CSE 1223 last semester) its all in sort of a foreign language to me. To me its like I'm learning English for the first time and I'm given the abc's or individual words (methods), a dictionary (the API), and a few lessons on basic grammar rules (contracts for the methods) and you are telling me to write and essay about a concept of its own. Thats obviously an oversimplified and a little bit exaggerated metaphor, but I think it makes sense. I am ok with writing an essay (code for a program) like that but I think it would be so much more efficient if we had more complex examples of real code, or examples of some sentences to continue my metaphor, about a different topic. For the kids in this class that are way more proficient and experienced at coding in general let alone in just java, it may not make the biggest difference, but for the people who feel lost sometimes it think it would make a world of difference. It's like expecting us to become better writers in English class without ever seeing examples of good writing on top of it being in a language we aren't very familiar with. I understand you can't give us examples of solutions to the projects we are doing, but it would still be helpful seeing them for other tasks. I know labs are kind of supposed to do this but once again its code we mostly create or just a partner's. Having you walk us through code live as you write it to solve a simple problem as an example or even you describing a possible coding solution to a problem that is already written would be immensely helpful so we can learn good coding practices and techniques from someone (you) who is good at coding. I know there isn't one correct answer to any of these coding projects or problems, but there are certainly better solutions than others and seeing some of the better solutions as someone who is writing the not as good solutions it would help me get out of the sort of echo chamber of the same coding techniques I know how to do because its the best I could come up with even though it may not be the best or most efficient way of doing things because I don't know anything different. As long as this whole comment was I was just trying to be thorough in my explanation because obviously you can't respond if you have any questions what I am talking about. I appreciate all the help you gave this semester and think you did great. I understand this class is supposed to be unnecessarily hard and I appreciate you taking the effort to make it easier for some innocent software I students who did nothing to deserve the hardships this class was meant to bring along."
2021,Autumn,CSE 2221,29428,Lecture,"Best instructor I met in OSU so far."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"Good"
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"He's one of the friendliest teachers I've ever seen"
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"Really good professor"
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"I cant say enough about this instructor. One of the best I have seen—really interested in teaching, available to the students, and helped everyone really understand the nuances of programming – which is an important value in any teacher."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"Amazing friendly personality, easily approachable for asking questions, made you think about the problem and didn't just give you the answer, and overall one of the best instructors I have ever had. We need more instructors like Jeremy at Ohio State."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"I think professor grifski was a great professor. He made sure to explain mostthoroughly and clearly which made the course a lot more interesting. Also, I appreciated his use of tophat where he would allow us to ask questions through it. I would definitely take him if he was available for any other CSE courses in the future."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"The instructor was THE BEST INSTRUCTOR I HAVE EVER HAD. He was amazing. He taught the information very nicely. Answered all questions and was willing to help us out in any way possible. I am extremely glad you got an award for teaching. You deserve it man!!!"
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"Jeremy did an amazing job with the material that was handed to him."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"I thought Jeremy was incredibly polite, thought provoking, and made for an excellent semester! However, I thought the course material, slides, and projects were poorly designed. Nothing seemed to flow very well from project to project, or homework to homework. I felt like there were far too many projects that don't let students reflect on deeper understanding of material, and that each project just involved us creating one or two methods using an esoteric object interface and class implementation. The slides were also written to teach people with preexisting software designation how to read an interpret the software. After less than a year of dealing with code, this made for a overwhelmingly confusing and largely restricted library of tools for each student to use."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"While the format of the class was a little confusing (with us trying to apply things on assignments we hadn't learned in class yet), the instructor was excellent in every way. He took what he could from the lectures, but was patient in explaining tough concepts to people, and was more than helpful if anyone sought him out for help."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"He knows about all the topics and was very flexible with how much he could be. He understood the struggles students were goingthrough and helped as much he could. I will always recommend this instructor while he is still available."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"great great instructor, overall very dedicated to his students, the only thing I didn't like was that he stopped lecturing when we went online. Paolos recorded lectures were next to useless so we had to do a lot of self teaching. I think watching recorded lectures is different from live ones because you can never ask for clarification. The q/a sessions were nice but I didn't have the motivation or time to watch all of paolos low quality lectures on top of attending all q/a's and labs"
2019,Autumn,CSE 2221,35160,Lecture,"Although there were some difficulties associated with this being his first time teaching the course, Jeremy is clearly passionate about teaching, and wanted us to succeed. If he had more control over the course material I think it would've been a much smoother experience overall. That being said, he worked really hard to make sure we understood what was going on –great professor."
2019,Autumn,CSE 2221,35160,Lecture,"Really enjoyed this professor throughout this course. He genuinely cared about his students and his teaching philosophy is great.

2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"Jeremy did a remarkable job for his first time teaching, let alone teaching this course. He was organized and tactful in his teaching method. He also provided resources to help us do our best. Jeremy was also willing to go above and beyond to be available and is always easy to reach. I was lucky to have such a great instructor."
2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"Enjoyed Jeremy and he did a great job but thought the course structure was not organized well. Most of the homework seemed too long for what it was worth. Projects did not always match up with what we were learning in class."

2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"I really liked him as a professor. He genuinely cared about us learning and even went outside of the box to make sure we truly understood coding rather than just making it so I could pass the test."
2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"Jeremy has been my favorite professor thus far during my time at Ohio state. He allowed each student to solve every problem in their own way and instead of helping them get back onto the cookie cutter route, he would evaluate your work and keep you moving forward with your specific track. Overall, 10/10"
