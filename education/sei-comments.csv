2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"Good"
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"He's one of the friendliest teachers I've ever seen"
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"Really good professor"
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"I cant say enough about this instructor. One of the best I have seen – really interested in teaching, available to the students, and helped everyone really understand the nuances of programming – which is an important value in any teacher."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"Amazing friendly personality, easily approachable for asking questions, made you think about the problem and didn't just give you the answer, and overall one of the best instructors I have ever had. We need more instructors like Jeremy at Ohio State."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"I think professor grifski was a great professor. He made sure to explain mostthoroughly and clearly which made the course a lot more interesting. Also, I appreciated his use of tophat where he would allow us to ask questions through it. I would definitely take him if he was available for any other CSE courses in the future."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"The instructor was THE BEST INSTRUCTOR I HAVE EVER HAD. He was amazing. He taught the information very nicely. Answered all questions and was willing to help us out in any way possible. I am extremely glad you got an award for teaching. You deserve it man!!!"
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"Jeremy did an amazing job with the material that was handed to him."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"I thought Jeremy was incredibly polite, thought provoking, and made for an excellent semester! However, I thought the course material, slides, and projects were poorly designed. Nothing seemed to flow very well from project to project, or homework to homework. I felt like there were far too many projects that don't let students reflect on deeper understanding of material, and that each project just involved us creating one or two methods using an esoteric object interface and class implementation. The slides were also written to teach people with preexisting software designation how to read an interpret the software. After less than a year of dealing with code, this made for a overwhelmingly confusing and largely restricted library of tools for each student to use."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"While the format of the class was a little confusing (with us trying to apply things on assignments we hadn't learned in class yet), the instructor was excellent in every way. He took what he could from the lectures, but was patient in explaining tough concepts to people, and was more than helpful if anyone sought him out for help."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"He knows about all the topics and was very flexible with how much he could be. He understood the struggles students were goingthrough and helped as much he could. I will always recommend this instructor while he is still available."
2020,Spring,CSE 2221,11278,Lecture,"great great instructor, overall very dedicated to his students, the only thing I didn't like was that he stopped lecturing when we went online. Paolos recorded lectures were next to useless so we had to do a lot of self teaching. I think watching recorded lectures is different from live ones because you can never ask for clarification. The q/a sessions were nice but I didn't have the motivation or time to watch all of paolos low quality lectures on top of attending all q/a's and labs"
2019,Autumn,CSE 2221,35160,Lecture,"Although there were some difficulties associated with this being his first time teaching the course, Jeremy is clearly passionate about teaching, and wanted us to succeed. If he had more control over the course material I think it would've been a much smoother experience overall. That being said, he worked really hard to make sure we understood what was going on –great professor."
2019,Autumn,CSE 2221,35160,Lecture,"Really enjoyed this professor throughout this course. He genuinely cared about his students and his teaching philosophy is great. One of the best teachers I've encountered and being able to have someone like that in a class that matters is much appreciated. Overall amazing teacher."
2019,Autumn,CSE 2221,35160,Lecture,"My best teacher this semester"
2019,Autumn,CSE 2221,35160,Lecture,"Fantastic teacher and I wish he taught software 2 and foundations as well just so I could have him again"
2019,Autumn,CSE 2221,35160,Lecture,"He is the best professor I have ever met!"

2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8281,Lecture,"I could tell the instructor was passionate about teaching, which created a great learning environment"
2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8281,Lecture,"Professor Grifski is an amazing professor. He clearly cares for his students and that they actually learn the material rather than just teach to the test."
2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8281,Lecture,"He is a great instructor. I hope he can teach another class."

2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8281,Lecture,"Jeremy was the best instructor I have had so far at Ohio a State. He genuinely loves teaching an he is so caring. He goes out of his way to ensure everyone understands. I can tell he has a passion for teaching and I would not have enjoyed or done well in the class at all if it was not for him."
2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8281,Lecture,"Nice teacher. Very helpful"
2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8282,Lab,"I could tell the instructor was passionate about teaching the class and that created a great learning environment."
2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8282,Lab,"He was always interested in teaching and helping students learn better ways to code. Was also very approachable and was easy to get help from."

2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8282,Lab,"More sample code could be helpful."
2019,Spring,CSE 1223,8282,Lab,"I love his class. He can answer all student problem."
2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"Jeremy did a remarkable job for his first time teaching, let alone teaching this course. He was organized and tactful in his teaching method. He also provided resources to help us do our best. Jeremy was also willing to go above and beyond to be available and is always easy to reach. I was lucky to have such a great instructor."
2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"Enjoyed Jeremy and he did a great job but thought the course structure was not organized well. Most of the homework seemed too long for what it was worth. Projects did not always match up with what we were learning in class."
2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"Jeremy was astounding! I'm so happy to have had him as an instructor."
2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"I really liked him as a professor. He genuinely cared about us learning and even went outside of the box to make sure we truly understood coding rather than just making it so I could pass the test."
2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,Lecture,"Jeremy has been my favorite professor thus far during my time at Ohio state. He allowed each student to solve every problem in their own way and instead of helping them get back onto the cookie cutter route, he would evaluate your work and keep you moving forward with your specific track. Overall, 10/10"
