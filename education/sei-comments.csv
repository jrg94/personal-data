He also provided resources to help us do our best. Jeremy was also willing to go above and beyond to be available and is always easy to reach. I was lucky to have such a great instructor."
12/21/2018,2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,"Enjoyed Jeremy and he did a great job but thought the course structure was not organized well. Most of the homework seemed too long for what it was worth. Projects did not always match up with what we were learning in class."
12/21/2018,2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,"Jeremy was astounding! I'm so happy to have had him as an instructor."
12/21/2018,2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,"I really liked him as a professor. He genuinely cared about us learning and even went outside of the box to make sure we truly understood coding rather than just making it so I could pass the test."
12/21/2018,2018,Autumn,CSE 1223,26319,"Jeremy has been my favorite professor thus far during my time at Ohio state. He allowed each student to solve every problem in their own way and instead of helping them get back onto the cookie cutter route, he would evaluate your work and keep you moving forward with your specific track. Overall, 10/10"
