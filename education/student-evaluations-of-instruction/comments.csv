1,8,Jeremy is hands down the best professor I've had at OSU.
2,8,"Easily the best professor / teacher I've had at any level of schooling. Cares about students, fair grader, and clearly loves to teach, I am extremely lucky to have had him as an instructor."
3,8,"It's very obvious that Jeremy cares about his students and wants everyone to succeed. He's very willing to accommodate students and help them understand the material. I had positive interactions with Jeremy in office hours and found him to be very helpful, however I did not enjoy his lecture style. He often caters to students who are already very familiar with coding lingo. He did not use the provided slides and instead asks leading questions that require tons of background knowledge. I often felt completely lost in class and had to go over the department slides on my own to teach myself."
4,8,"Jeremy has been invested in his students since day one. He is understanding and patient but also always challenges us to do our best. I have gotten more out of Software 2 with him than I would've with any other professor. His approach allows us to learn and understand the information instead of just memorize it then forget it. Any concerns I had in his class were because of how the department structured the course and not because of Jeremy. He genuinely cares about his students and their wellbeing, which is unlike many professors. I am thankful that I was able to have him as my professor for Software 1 & 2."
5,8,"Jeremy is an amazing instructor. He was very proactive and engaged with the students throughout the course and he worked hard to alleviate as much stress as possible from the students and allowed students to learn from their mistakes. This course can be very challenging at times and having Jeremy as an instructor helped immensely in not only succeeding, but learning as much as possible about the core ideas in the course. It is also very beneficial for the students that Jeremy is very knowledgeable in the field because he was able to understand and provide solutions to questions asked by students. Jeremy held the midterm 2 and the final online, and I would actually suggest just keeping the exams in person because from what he said, there was a lot more cheating in the online test. Another thing that he can do for next semesters is to record and upload the lectures because I noticed that a good amount of students would not attend class, and maybe this would help the overall grade of the classes. Otherwise, I have no other critiques, anyone who gets Jeremy as their instructor is a lucky student, just like me."
6,8,"I think Jeremy is the ideal teacher for teaching all course level of computer programming classes. He enables critical thinking and encourages peer discussion to answer questions that would lead to later topics. Furthermore, instead of creating punishing exams, he would outline skills and topics that would potentially show up and allow us to remedy projects if we knew how to fix it. Overall, I wish instructors in cs courses would learn from Jeremy's teaching style and adopt their style of it."
7,8,Jeremy is one of the best CSE instructors I have had that genuinely cares for his students
8,8,Best professor in the CSE department.
9,8,Genuinely cares that students learn the material.
10,8,"Greatest professor in OSU! Absolute legend. I am so happy to finally have a professor in CSE that truly cares about students. God bless this man. And if there's no god, this man IS the god."
11,8,It has been an amazing experience learning from Instructor Grifski and I have overall gained knowledge and skills that I otherwise wouldn't have gotten from other instructors due to his tutorship.
12,8,Professor Grifski has a genuine love for teaching and it shows. He wants all of his students to not just learn the material but excel within the course and in our careers. He is almost always available and I found his office hours extremely helpful. He is extremely knowledgable in the field of CSE and I enjoyed his discord announcements as well.
13,8,"Great instructor, great class, 10 out of 10 all around!"
14,8,amazing
15,8,"Amazing professor. Definitely loved what he does, very interested in the material. Made class fun and was very ethical, in terms of doing what it best for students to learn. 100% would take this teacher again, no doubt. Easily the best teacher I have had in college so far."
16,8,"Jeremy is one of the best professors I've ever had. He really cares about his students and makes sure everyone does their best. Besides, his teaching style helps students think critically and not just read the slides."
17,8,"Jeremy Grifski is a great instructor, but the class is disorganized and outdated. This is not Jeremy's fault though, as the class is standardized. Jeremy has great ideas for the course, as he truly cares for students and understands how we learn best, but he can only do so much being restricted by the way the course is set up. I would choose Jeremy as course coordinator if I could."
18,8,"Love Jeremy! He's an amazing Professor, and makes everything simple enough for a toddler. Wouldn't have gotten through this class without him. But.... I HATE, keyword 'HATE' the CSE Department. Again I HATE the CSE department."
19,8,Jeremy truly cares for his student. He always thinks what could actually help student to learn.
20,8,Best
21,8,"Mr. Grifski cares about his students' success, and tries his best to give us more opportunities and resources. He genuinely cares and is very kind."
22,8,Professor Grifski really cares about if students really learn the concept and he himself is a very knowledgeable programmer. I feel like I learned so much from him and he is very active in office hours. I am very grateful for having him as my professor this semester.
23,8,"Very good professor, always help students with class work and other questions like in further academic career. I really got help a lot from him!"
24,7,Best instructor I ever had since college
25,7,VERY EXCELLENT INSTRUCTOR.
26,7,Best professor I've ever had!
27,7,"Mr Grifski is a nice teacher,"
28,7,"Jeremy is a rare type of instructor. You can tell through his passion of pedagogy that he genuinely loves to teach. He wants his students to succeed, and gives them opportunities that make that possible. Additionally, although some of the software sequence's material is quite dated, Jeremy still makes the lectures engaging. Finally, he's an innovator and has suggested novel ways to improve the course, such as through the pilot project that was introduced this semester. 10 out of 10"
29,7,"He is knowledgeable on the material, always well prepared for all the classes. He really cares what and how we learn even beyond the class. I hope he teaches my every single cse class. :)"
30,7,"This professor made a clear effort in building on the established course content provided by the CSE department and went out of his way to improve class participation including group discussion, opportunities for feedback, and peer review portions. The overall cookie cutter nature of the Software Sequence classes where every goes through the exact same slideshow year after year is lame and this professor put a clear effort into improving that curriculum with their own slideshows and day to day lesson plans. They provided templates and rubrics for all homeworks, checklists for projects, answer keys for past assignments and a wealth of support for exam prep."
31,7,Awesome!
32,7,"The greatest professor I've ever had, changed my perspective on computer science and reignited my passion !"
33,7,Best teacher I've ever had and most likely ever will.
34,7,Jeremy Grifski is one of the most effective and understanding instructors I've ever had. His communication is amazing.
35,7,Jeremey Grifski is quite literally the best professor at The Ohio State University
36,7,Thank you so much for your hard work! I wish more Professors were more like you!
37,7,Best professor I've had so far.
38,7,"One of the best professors, genuinely makes the learning interesting and fun and gives opportunities to redeem yourself."
39,7,"I really like Jeremy's course!! He indeed takes care of students' demands, makes the lessons interesting, and has a lot of in-class discussion participation to help students understand why we study this and where it comes from. I promise Jeremy is the best professor I've ever met."
40,7,Definitely the best instructor I've had in CSE
41,7,Genuinely cares about students
42,7,One of the best teachers I've had at osu
43,7,nice lec
44,7,The best teacher I have ever had. Truly cares for his students and goes to great lengths to help us succeed. He is able to relate to us and understands how we can learn better and works best for us. Allows us to think about the concepts and understand why they are rather than just reading off a slideshow.
45,6,"Wonderful professor, went over subjects in ways that can be comprehendible and easier to understand, and was patient to go over subjects students can find themselves struggling on. 10 out of 10 would recommend!"
46,6,He is the best
47,6,Having the topics being broken down and given the reasoning behind how and why things function versus simply going through slides was helpful in making things easier to understand. The slides essentially became an additional vs main resource which was nice especially when the slides seemed lacking in explanation
48,6,Jeremy for Dept. Chair.
49,6,"Jeremy was really good at making sure that we were on track to pass the class, meeting our needs in terms of doing well in the course, but also making sure that we were learning."
50,6,Jeremy's class was not only enjoyable but kept my morale up throughout the semester. I find his teaching and instruction styles to be really beneficial!
51,6,Best CSE Professor
52,6,"This class was a thoroughly enjoyable and informative class that helped have a somewhat competent mastery on understanding components for programming in Java, as well as a better grasp of how to problem solve."
53,6,The best teacher I have ever had at OSU!
54,6,Amazing teacher
55,6,Let him run the department. He's The best teacher
56,6,A really caring professor who wants you to do well and learn
57,6,Jeremy Grifski is one of the most helpful professors I have ever had.
58,6,Made it so that I was actually interested in learning. With the way exams were formatted and bonus project I feel like I was actually able to learn the content properly and think that it put me in a much better position than my peers with other instructors. Also was a very chill guy who actually cares about well being of students and would always give helpful insights and career advice. Could not have asked for a better Professor.
59,6,"Fantastic professor, I can tell he's genuinely interested in helping the students learn. Pilot project is an amazing idea"
60,6,"I think Jeremy takes this boring class and makes it interesting. He lets us discuss these topics in small groups then we discuss them as a class which is very beneficial for learning. It is better than just reading the osu course slides which make no sense most of the time or are very unhelpful. I think Jeremy is the best professor for this class he understands that we are students who have more than this class to work on and that college can be stressful. Overall Jeremy is the best professor for the software sequence by far I feel like he wants his students to learn and is willing to work with them, especially with the pilot project which is amazing because it gives us real-life applications of what we have learned so far."
61,6,"Jeremy is an excellent instructor who created a very positive environment for students to thrive in. He would take time outside of class to help students, as well as foster a creative learning space."
62,6,I can easily say that Jeremy Grifski is one of if not the greatest teacher I have ever had. The way he ran and taught this class made it very engaging and thoughtful. He also was able to cultivate an amazing learning community within the class which made it a wonderful place to learn. The amount of knowledge and confidence I have gained through this course is unmatched. I truly think that I am beyond ahead of what I would be if I had any other professor for this class.
63,6,"Amazing professor, you could really tell that he cared about his students and his class. Actually engaged the class and gets them to think about the topics instead of just reading off a slideshow given to him. He works with any struggling students and encourages learning outside the class as well. One of my favorite professors of all time"
64,6,Very nice and helpful professor who really cares.
65,6,Professor Grifski is so caring for his students. He genuinely wants everyone to be successful in this course. He would go out of his way to help his students succeed. It was a blessing to take this course with him. I would highly recommend him to anyone. I would take every CSE course with him if he teaches them. Thank you so much Professor Grifski! Best professor ever.
66,6,"The instructor tried to teach as well as he could and would also identify where he thought there were flaws in the curriculum and tried to make sure what we were learning would be beneficial to us in the future (though he of course would still teach the content). He offered various opportunities for us students to think for ourselves with a project where we would create our own kernel classes, which drastically improved my understanding of class heirarchies, which I didn't really understand before."
67,6,"Jeremy is great, he actually tried to teach us and made us engaged. He needs a raise."
68,4,Best professor I have had at OSU
69,4,Jeremy is
70,4,Probably one of the best Software I instructors.
71,4,Great professor and always interesting in helping students.
72,4,Jeremy is an excellent professor who truly gives students the flexibility necessary to excel in these degree paths
73,4,Best teacher I've ever had in one of the hardest classes I've had to take so far. Fantastic job.
74,4,"I love Prof. Grifski. He is a positive, friendly, and helpful instructor. He goes above and beyond to help students outside of class and accommodates everyone's needs. I am happy with my grade, but if I were to receive an F in this course, it would be because of a lack of effort on my part, because Prof. Grifski gives you all of the resources, office hours, help, and second chances to succeed in his class. I actually failed my first coding course at OSU, so I didn't feel confident at the beginning of Software I. I was so distressed that I used to cry thinking about that class and taking more programming classes, but because of the relaxed and supportive class environment, I feel a lot better in Software I. The online class Discord makes it much easier for us to contact the TA's, graders, and the prof outside of class. I also noticed that the professor encourages us before and after the midterms so we feel don't feel too bad about receiving a low score. He makes his own slides, collects data about all our assignments, attendance, grades, etc. and shares it with us so that we know what to expect for this course. He has a blog and writes articles that are helpful and relevant to the class concepts and assignments. It's also notable that Prof. Grifski is open in communicating his opinions on the course content and structure, and gives us advice on which labs/topics are important. It allows for students to share their concerns and frustrations in a healthy way with the instructor, who seems to value student feedback. I would say that this instructor made a learning environment that allowed us to succeed and improve our programming skills and boost our confidence. I feel happy to be in his class, and all of the classmates I have talked with have also expressed positive experiences with Prof. Grifski."
75,4,He really cares about helping his students
76,4,Jeremy is easily one of the best professors I have ever had he is always willing to help and wants his students to pass his class. I think this is a hard class with outdated material but he made it interesting and relatable and I think he should universally teach this class.
77,4,Best instructor I've ever had.
78,4,"Best instructor i've ever had. And i mean that genuinely. He listens to concerns, provides really good help with any assignments when needed, and is always available when a student needs anything. Excellent teaching style that is very straight forward and helps reenforce key concepts."
79,4,Best teacher
80,4,Couldn't ask better professor than Jeremy.
81,4,"Instructor used many methods to set students up for success, including custom presentations, detailed exam preparations, and arranged class activities with other students to learn the class content. Overall one of the best professors I had at OSU."
82,4,Great class
83,4,Jeremy is an amazing software professor and really helped me build my programming skills
84,4,Best professor I have had so far. Great guy.
85,4,"Jeremy was incredibly helpful throughout the semester, and I feel very satisfied with what I have learned in this class. I always felt comfortable asking Jeremy for help and he was a great resource to help me learn."
86,4,Mr. Grifski was one of the best teachers/instructors I have ever had.
87,4,Made a class that is designed to make students fail into an interesting class. Absolutely loved this professor. Was very down to earth and willing to help all of his students if they are willing to put forth effort. I have no problems with the professor just how the class was designed.
88,4,Not Applicable
89,4,"One of the best instructors I have had in this university, he accomplished a lot with what he had available."
90,4,Very understanding and does everything possible to put his students in a position to succeed.
91,4,Jeremy is probably one of the best instructors I've had so far!
92,4,This course is a weird one where some students just get it and others don't. As someone who got it I felt like the course was a bit slow and uninteresting but I could clearly tell that the instructor wanted to make certain that everyone was set up to succeed.
93,5,"Jeremy is a great instructor and a great person. He always made class interesting and encouraged students to network and get to know each other. Jeremy was always very understanding and flexible. He genuinely cares about his students. Overall, he was a great instructor and I was lucky to have class with him!"
94,5,"Best teacher at OSU, wish all my teachers were at his level."
95,5,Jeremy is an excellent professor. He was very excited to teach us and helped me greatly throughout the semester. I enjoyed the class a lot because of him.
96,5,I love Jeremy
97,5,"Jeremy is an absolutely incredible and understanding professor. Despite going through personal hardships this semester, he was still amazingly helpful and taught the material exceptionally. I am grateful to have had such a great professor for this class."
98,5,The best professor I've had in five years. Was actively helpful and proactive in addressing potential confusing parts of topics and taught topics in a way that made them easy to understand and apply in homework/assignments.
99,5,The most caring and helpful professor I have had thus far
100,5,"Jeremy is the best professor I've had so far at Ohio State. He really cares about the students and makes sure we actually learn, not just memorize for a test and then forget."
101,5,Not Applicable
102,5,Arguably the best instructor I've ever had. Super helpful and always available and willing to meet. I truly feel like Jeremy was one of the main reasons I was able to be successful in this course.
103,5,Not Applicable
104,5,"One of the best professor I had for software, I learned a lot and he was able to be there to help when needed"
105,5,Jeremy Grifski is probably one of the best professors I ever had.
106,5,"Jeremy was a great professor and he was always very helpful whenever I had questions. I especially like how he uses discord as a 'hub' for this class, and it made it very easy to ask questions and just bounce ideas off other students. It was also helpful because I could see what other students had asked and how they were able to solve their problems."
107,5,"Best professor I've ever had, one of the greatest teachers I've ever had, should have a full time teaching position, probably should be head of the department. This guy knows what he's talking about and he really cares about the students. Best professor."
108,5,"Jeremy was great, he cares so much about his students and is just as frustrated with how the class is set up as we are"
109,5,"I would certainly say I lucked out with having Jeremy as my professor for Software 1. The class is notorious for its difficulty and arguable unfairness, yet he somehow manages to make sure that all students in his class are given the right tools to succeed all while answering every little question people may have. The course is inherently poorly organized in my opinion since a lot of the content is very outdated and the grading is particularly harsh, but that is no fault of the instructor. Seriously a great classroom experience."
110,5,"Jeremy explains concepts really clearly, would definitely take his course again!"
111,5,"Jeremy is one of the best instructors/teachers I've ever had. He motivates me to pursue computer science and programming. He has managed to make a course that is notably very bad, something a little more enjoyable."
112,5,Best professor
113,5,"Super easy to talk to, fast response time, knowledgeable and understanding, fun to learn from."
114,5,"The course itself leaves a lot to be desired; it is extremely work heavy, overly challenging, outdated, and poorly organized, but Jeremy did an excellent job at making sure we got the most out of the class and offered plenty of support for us."
115,5,I struggled with this class and it's material but he was always very interested in helping me and making sure I could understand the material as much as I could. He also was very understanding about outside conflicts and was always welcoming so that I could ask as many questions as I wanted
116,5,Jeremy was always willing to help out his students and created an environment where students were comfortable with asking questions.
117,5,"Best teacher I've had, very helpful and easy to relate with."
118,11,"Professor Grifski is an incredible professor who works diligently to prepare his students for the rigours of computer science. He is more than reasonable with arranging time to speak with students and labours to ensure that students feel capable and equipped to follow the curriculum. Professor Grifski’s dedication to education and empathy create a classroom community where everybody feels safe, competent and capable of learning, and ready to assist one another. He is rigorous but just, and Ohio State University should count itself lucky to have him."
119,11,Jeremy is a fantastic instructor and you can tell he actually wants to see his students succeed
120,11,The instructor made sure that what we needed to take away from the  we got through a “debrief”. Office hours right after class also helped tremendously.
121,11,He really focused on making sure we learned the material well rather than just memorizing for a test. He also helped us understand why were learning the things we were learning and how they would be helpful/not as helpful to us in the future.
122,11,Overall great instructor.
123,11,"This was my first computer science class going beyond the basics of coding and syntax, so it helped me connect with the computer science community by learning more uses of the medium and best practices. It was also great having the class discord where you could ask questions and get a quick response from an instructor or another student. (Even in the late hours of the night, as it seemed.)"
124,11,"The course was taught in a very clear way that caused me to learn a lot. The group activities were usually unproductive, but I was still able to get a look at the content to be discussed which I liked. I really liked the discord, it saved me on many assignments as office hours were limited and I was able to get my questions answered. Very nice of you to be so available and willing to help!"
125,11,"I think discussing any issues or questions with other students was really beneficial, through the class group chat, as the other people also understood what we were working with. However, because we use OSU libraries, I feel like I don't really know much practical information as the coding that I learned won't help me too much in the real world, except for things like different variable types or methods"
126,11,Mr. Grifski was the best teacher I've ever had for a software class. I wish he was teaching software 2 because I would sign up for his class again.
127,11,Very educated in the course he was teaching and provided lots of material to further understand the things discussed in class.
128,11,Jeremy is a great instructor for learning cse2221. He tried his best to help students understand the knowledge and made some efforts to fix some unreasonable arrangement from the given syllabus
129,11,A great instructor as my first college teacher and he was able to ease me into the rigors of CSE
130,11,Professor Grifski is truly a great teacher. He helped the students understand the subject matter thoroughly and would ensure that they understood the concepts. He encouraged everyone to chat with each other and create a community of sorts which manifested itself into a great atmosphere. He treats you as an equal and is not condescending in the slightest bit which also contributed to the truly remarkable classroom environment. Though the one gripe was when reviewing his slides was a bit vague and did require more studying but the concepts when learning was conducted well. He is a role model for how teaching should be done.
131,11,Great Software 1 instructor. Q: What are some ways that this course made you feel more connected to the computer science community? A: Going on the discord server & talking about CS/helping out with questions made me feel more connected with the community.
132,11,This instructor is AMAZING
133,11,"He was incredibly helpful and understanding of our situations. His classes were structured to encourage discussion and peer—learning, and it was very helpful. He transparently understood the limitations of the course, and strove to introduce us to how the real world applies/doesn't apply what we learn in class. He was easily my favorite instructor during my time at Ohio State so far."
134,9,Did a great job!
135,9,"Professor Grifsky was honestly one of the best professors I have ever met. He is such an open, relatable, approachable, understanding, and caring guy. On the first day of class, I could immediately tell that he was not going to be like your average professor. He does so much and puts so much effort into making sure that he is doing what's best for his students. I am thankful that I had the pleasure of being one of his students this semester."
136,9,Great teacher with a caring attitude and wealth of knowledge.
137,9,Best course this year
138,9,The best instructor I have ever had so far at OSU and I'm a second year. He genuinely wants to help the students in his class succeed and always goes the extra mile. Used a discord to communicate with the class which was an absolutely amazing idea as it served everyone so amazingly. Always finds a way to keep the material interesting and humorous while making sure everyone understands. I would recommend Dr. Grifski to anyone interested in taking CSE 2221.
139,9,Mr. Gifski is really patience and he will answer almost every question we asked. He can explain all the concept every well and I think he trid his best to help each of us with ur projects .
140,9,"In my 4 years of college, I have never had an instructor like Jeremy Grifski. From the first day of class I left knowing that this course was going to be challenging but I was so thankful he was assigned to my section. I've never experienced a professor who I felt genuinely cared about each and every student. While I've been told by many professors 'I care about all of you' Jeremy actually showed it. We all know he has his hands full, being in school himself while teaching 2 sections but you would never know it. Anytime you ask him for anything he makes sure he is intentional with providing specifically what you need. On top of that, he created one, if not the best learning environments I've ever been in. No one was afraid to speak up, give input or ask questions. He challenged and succeeded in getting us students to engage with each other, which is very hard in a world that is so socially distant. But most importantly he built a trust bond with us and we built one with him. We student really trusted that he was going to prepare us for not just the projects and tests in the class but the real world as well. After each assignment and test, we saw that this guy isn't lying to us. He's genuinely preparing us for everything he says he will and it makes it so much easier to listen, engage and learn from someone like that. He asked us today in class 'What's one thing in 5 years from now that you'll take with you from this class?' While he was referring to specific material taught all I could think about was how amazing his teaching and was, how I felt like I had a teacher in my corner rooting for me and not trying to play tricks and reach for a standardized bell curve. I'm not kidding, I would take this course over again just because of how much I loved being in his class and from my conversations with others taking the same course with a different instructor, they can't say the same. Jeremy should be a leading example to any and all college professors of how to create a positive, healthy and successful learning environment."
141,9,"Mr. Grifski is awesome, and I consider him to be one of the best professors I've had so far here at Ohio State. You can tell he loves teaching, and he's always available to help students when needed. He's also quite clearly an expert with the course material and really knows what he's doing. 10/10."
142,9,"Jeremy Grifski is a kind and helpful professor.He create a discord channel so that students can ask question via it instead of email. In fact, from my experience of this semester, the discord channel is more helpful than email. When I asked problem on discord, someone on class would answer it immediately."
143,9,More practice problems for the course material would be good. ones that include actual programming in eclipse.
144,9,Gem of a human being.
145,9,"Although the class structure is a bit outdated and frustrating, this teacher made it as accommodating as possible for his students, made me feel not afraid to ask questions or get things wrong, overall very supportive and communicated frequently and effectively with the class"
146,9,One of my favorite CSE professors. Went above and beyond to make sure students had what they needed to excel.
147,9,"The best professor in CSE, period. he teaches the class in his own way and explains the complicated concepts in the relatively easier way so the students would understand them better. also, he is very responsive when you ask him questions on the discord chat, so you get the help you need for your projects, homework, or exam prep in a timely manner. thanks Jeremy!"
148,9,he method of explaining topics are clear and easily understood and if someone needed more input on the matter he made it his mission to help that student.
149,9,Office hours with him were really helpful
150,10,"The best instructor you can get in such a tough course, and probably my favorite instructor on campus."
151,10,"Jeremy does a great job helping us and getting us through the difficult learning curve of programming. He's extremely patient and positive, and it seems like he has a genuine interest in everyone's success."
152,10,Jeremy is probably the best professor I've had so far.
153,10,He was always attentive to students needs during class and lab and always eager to answer students questions
154,10,Good class
155,10,He was patient with work and understanding. He helped walk us through the content very easily. He deserves a raise tbh.
156,10,Best teacher I have had in college. Wish I could have Jeremy for software 2 and beyond.
157,10,The instructor included tips that could be used in the workspace and included a free to think space where students felt comfortable.
158,10,Jeremy Grifski is the best professor I've ever had in school. He creates the best environment for learning and is the most understanding person as well. I wish all professors were like him.
159,10,He was the best professor I've ever had and he truly cared about us as people
160,10,He provided many resources for us. He even had his own website with great information.
161,10,"Jeremy did a wonderful job teaching this class. Software I is a very hard class but I think it is a result of the course director and the content he comes up with. Jeremy knows that the class is meant to be hard and explains the test is designed to make us fail. As a result, he tries to help us out as much as possible. He is always willing to work extra with us to make sure we understand it. He is available outside of class to contact him and get help. Overall, Jeremy is a good teacher, but the class is awful and I wouldn't want to take it again due to the class structure."
162,10,I found Jeremy to be an engaging and helpful instructor. The course is organized very well and Jeremy was incredibly easy to approach.
163,10,Jeremy is a very good professor who wants to see his students succeed
164,10,The discord chat was a simple but extremely helpful tool in finding advice and assistance on the assignments. Being flexible with due dates was a huge help and took off stress when there were other things to be completed.
165,10,GOAT
166,10,Jeremy Grifski is an excelent instructor who clearly has a passion for teaching students. He genuinely cares about students succeeding and is very open and honest about everything.
167,10,"Incredible instructor, made a real effort to engage students in the material and created a very safe learning environment."
168,10,"Jeremy is the first teacher I've met that I know 100% is on my side. He wants his students to succeed, and he's willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen. Great guy, great teacher."
169,10,I couldn't have asked for a better lecturer for Software I. Was super helpful and willing to reach out to student both in and out of class. His more straightforward approach teaching definitely helped me and many others in this class.
170,10,Best professor
171,10,Jeremy is an excellent instructor. He really cares about his students.
172,10,"Amazing, best teacher I have ever had. Very personable and funny, but also very smart and understands the material very well. I wish he could teach every one of my comp sci classes. Thanks Jeremy!"
173,10,"Was interested in teaching, wasn't afraid to say course could be better, tried to help students. Cared about students."
174,10,"By far one the best instuctors I've had at Ohio State. The actual course content of CSE 2221 can be mixed at times, but Grifski still manages to make it consistently interesting. His passion for helping students both in and outside the classroom elevates his class far above what it needs to be. As someone who wishes to pursue higher level education, I'm taking Grifski's class as a shining example of what an instructor is capable of."
175,10,"Jeremy created an excellent environment in the classroom and for online learning. I liked the amount of freedom we had throughout the semester, but I also appreciated the tips he gave us. Overall, I really liked having him for this class."
176,12,"He did a great job teaching us the content, in a stimulating way for every student."
177,12,This class was amazing! I really hope you consider taking more courses! The education sector needs more instructors like you!
178,12,"He took the class itself, which isn't structured the best, and made it into something compelling and exciting to learn about. Calls out a lot of bs in the CSE department, which I appreciate. I love a teacher that knows the flaws in something and still tries to make the best out of it. Would definitely recommend him."
179,12,Jeremy was the best instructor/teacher I've had in my entire life. He's awesome!
180,12,Really wish he could teach all of my CSE classes. You could tell he is passionate about the material.
181,12,He was aware of the shortcomings in the course material itself and specifically planned around it while also listening to student feedback
182,12,"I hate how this course is organized and taught like it's the 1990s, but Jeremy was a great instructor and gave us all of the information we needed to know. Hands down best instructor I've had so far in college. He also takes time outside of class to make sure his students understand the content and is understanding about adjusting deadlines as needed. I felt well prepared for every exam and project. Keep it up Jeremy!!"
183,12,Great instructor! I learned a lot from Professor Grifski.
184,12,He was a very good professor. Went out of his way to improve the course material as he viewed it as inadequate in some areas.
185,12,"Jeremy Grifski was an amazing teacher. One of, if not the best, instructors I've ever had. He was absolutely fantastic and was always open to any questions. He was also always really understanding of any unlucky circumstances that may happen to students and always was flexible in accommodating. He also always make time for his students, especially outside of class."
186,12,"i love u jeremy, thank you so much for being a great teacher. the class was really nice and it's obvious that you really care about your students."
187,12,"Grifiki is a kind person who really cares for his students. He is enthusitic of teaching and try to let his students to engage. He always stay at lab and answer a lot of questions of his students. All in all, he is a great professor."
188,12,Thank you so much for the great class! You are the most awesome instructor I've ever had!
189,12,The interactive lecture—style was helpful
190,12,Passionate instructor
191,12,Great instructor
192,12,"You did a great job this semester teaching us. The only thing I would change about the class I would change is instead of going through slides with the most basic examples of methods for all the Osu components like natural number, I would go through those more quickly and then show real examples of code with multiple methods from natural number, sequence, or whatever component you are teaching in eclipse or something like that and show editing the code in real time and what it does to end result by changing variables or lines of code. In this course we really don’t see any examples of real code that's not just the simplest examples of methods separate from each other besides our own code that we create for the most part on our own. For me, who is someone with little to no coding experience before this class (zero coding in high school and I didn't even know what I didn't know in CSE 1223 last semester) its all in sort of a foreign language to me. To me its like I'm learning English for the first time and I'm given the abc's or individual words (methods), a dictionary (the API), and a few lessons on basic grammar rules (contracts for the methods) and you are telling me to write and essay about a concept of its own. Thats obviously an oversimplified and a little bit exaggerated metaphor, but I think it makes sense. I am ok with writing an essay (code for a program) like that but I think it would be so much more efficient if we had more complex examples of real code, or examples of some sentences to continue my metaphor, about a different topic. For the kids in this class that are way more proficient and experienced at coding in general let alone in just java, it may not make the biggest difference, but for the people who feel lost sometimes it think it would make a world of difference. It's like expecting us to become better writers in English class without ever seeing examples of good writing on top of it being in a language we aren't very familiar with. I understand you can't give us examples of solutions to the projects we are doing, but it would still be helpful seeing them for other tasks. I know labs are kind of supposed to do this but once again its code we mostly create or just a partner's. Having you walk us through code live as you write it to solve a simple problem as an example or even you describing a possible coding solution to a problem that is already written would be immensely helpful so we can learn good coding practices and techniques from someone (you) who is good at coding. I know there isn't one correct answer to any of these coding projects or problems, but there are certainly better solutions than others and seeing some of the better solutions as someone who is writing the not as good solutions it would help me get out of the sort of echo chamber of the same coding techniques I know how to do because its the best I could come up with even though it may not be the best or most efficient way of doing things because I don't know anything different. As long as this whole comment was I was just trying to be thorough in my explanation because obviously you can't respond if you have any questions what I am talking about. I appreciate all the help you gave this semester and think you did great. I understand this class is supposed to be unnecessarily hard and I appreciate you taking the effort to make it easier for some innocent software I students who did nothing to deserve the hardships this class was meant to bring along."
193,12,Best instructor I met in OSU so far.
194,13,Good
195,13,He's one of the friendliest teachers I've ever seen
196,13,Really good professor
197,13,"I cant say enough about this instructor. One of the best I have seen—really interested in teaching, available to the students, and helped everyone really understand the nuances of programming – which is an important value in any teacher."
198,13,"Amazing friendly personality, easily approachable for asking questions, made you think about the problem and didn't just give you the answer, and overall one of the best instructors I have ever had. We need more instructors like Jeremy at Ohio State."
199,13,"I think professor grifski was a great professor. He made sure to explain mostthoroughly and clearly which made the course a lot more interesting. Also, I appreciated his use of tophat where he would allow us to ask questions through it. I would definitely take him if he was available for any other CSE courses in the future."
200,13,The instructor was THE BEST INSTRUCTOR I HAVE EVER HAD. He was amazing. He taught the information very nicely. Answered all questions and was willing to help us out in any way possible. I am extremely glad you got an award for teaching. You deserve it man!!!
201,13,Jeremy did an amazing job with the material that was handed to him.
202,13,"I thought Jeremy was incredibly polite, thought provoking, and made for an excellent semester! However, I thought the course material, slides, and projects were poorly designed. Nothing seemed to flow very well from project to project, or homework to homework. I felt like there were far too many projects that don't let students reflect on deeper understanding of material, and that each project just involved us creating one or two methods using an esoteric object interface and class implementation. The slides were also written to teach people with preexisting software designation how to read an interpret the software. After less than a year of dealing with code, this made for a overwhelmingly confusing and largely restricted library of tools for each student to use."
203,13,"While the format of the class was a little confusing (with us trying to apply things on assignments we hadn't learned in class yet), the instructor was excellent in every way. He took what he could from the lectures, but was patient in explaining tough concepts to people, and was more than helpful if anyone sought him out for help."
204,13,He knows about all the topics and was very flexible with how much he could be. He understood the struggles students were goingthrough and helped as much he could. I will always recommend this instructor while he is still available.
205,13,"great great instructor, overall very dedicated to his students, the only thing I didn't like was that he stopped lecturing when we went online. Paolos recorded lectures were next to useless so we had to do a lot of self teaching. I think watching recorded lectures is different from live ones because you can never ask for clarification. The q/a sessions were nice but I didn't have the motivation or time to watch all of paolos low quality lectures on top of attending all q/a's and labs"
206,16,"Although there were some difficulties associated with this being his first time teaching the course, Jeremy is clearly passionate about teaching, and wanted us to succeed. If he had more control over the course material I think it would've been a much smoother experience overall. That being said, he worked really hard to make sure we understood what was going on –great professor."
207,16,Really enjoyed this professor throughout this course. He genuinely cared about his students and his teaching philosophy is great. One of the best teachers I've encountered and being able to have someone like that in a class that matters is much appreciated. Overall amazing teacher.
208,16,My best teacher this semester
209,16,Fantastic teacher and I wish he taught software 2 and foundations as well just so I could have him again
210,16,He is the best professor I have ever met!
211,16,Amazing instructor. He was involved with students and was very understanding.
212,14,"I could tell the instructor was passionate about teaching, which created a great learning environment"
213,14,Professor Grifski is an amazing professor. He clearly cares for his students and that they actually learn the material rather than just teach to the test.
214,14,He is a great instructor. I hope he can teach another class.
215,14,An awesome professor. Very helpful and learned a lot from him. Enjoyed the whole semester.
216,14,Jeremy was the best instructor I have had so far at Ohio a State. He genuinely loves teaching an he is so caring. He goes out of his way to ensure everyone understands. I can tell he has a passion for teaching and I would not have enjoyed or done well in the class at all if it was not for him.
217,14,Nice teacher. Very helpful
218,15,I could tell the instructor was passionate about teaching the class and that created a great learning environment.
219,15,He was always interested in teaching and helping students learn better ways to code. Was also very approachable and was easy to get help from.
220,15,"Jeremy was so amazing. His passion for teaching and the subject really shown during class, lab, and office hours. I am very happy I got him as an instructor."
221,15,I like his teaching style. Class is interesting and he is always willing to help students. Also we get a feedback for every assignment.
222,15,More sample code could be helpful.
223,15,I love his class. He can answer all student problem.
224,17,"Jeremy did a remarkable job for his first time teaching, let alone teaching this course. He was organized and tactful in his teaching method. He also provided resources to help us do our best. Jeremy was also willing to go above and beyond to be available and is always easy to reach. I was lucky to have such a great instructor."
225,17,Enjoyed Jeremy and he did a great job but thought the course structure was not organized well. Most of the homework seemed too long for what it was worth. Projects did not always match up with what we were learning in class.
226,17,Jeremy was astounding! I'm so happy to have had him as an instructor.
227,17,I really liked him as a professor. He genuinely cared about us learning and even went outside of the box to make sure we truly understood coding rather than just making it so I could pass the test.
228,17,"Jeremy has been my favorite professor thus far during my time at Ohio state. He allowed each student to solve every problem in their own way and instead of helping them get back onto the cookie cutter route, he would evaluate your work and keep you moving forward with your specific track. Overall, 10/10"
229,1,"Professor Grifski is the best lecturer i have ever had. I really do wish I could have him again in the future. He actually teaches and cares about the well-being of his students. Thank you Professor Grifski, i appreciate you. Fatherhood suits you !"
230,1,"Genuinely the greatest professor I have ever had in college. I had a slew of medical extenuating circumstances, and my parents got divorced, but Jeremy was always there for me. I am truly grateful that I got to take his class and meet him. He's a stellar professor and human being!"
231,1,"Very friendly, understanding, and enthusiastic"
232,1,Genuinly my best professor so far. You can tell he really cares about his students and makes it fun to learn and engage. Felt a great connection and it made the semester so much better.
233,1,"This class is a sort of weird blend of traditional and nontraditional, but I really liked it and thought Jeremy Grifski taught it very effectively. I'm a big fan of how honest he is about everything, including the material itself and how it applies to life after college. A lot of his particular policies, such as how he handles attendance and participation, definitely improved my quality of life and ability to learn; I did not often stress out about this class needlessly, as I might in some other classes, because of how the course is set up and how Jeremy teaches it. My only complaint about this course is that there are way, way too many homeworks, and cumulatively they're only worth 6% of the grade... I had no drive to actually do any of them past the first two weeks."
234,1,"The best professor I've had in a long long time"
235,1,"I would give excellent but due to him having a child and us having a substitute for half of the class this class became a bit iffy and I didn't do as well as I would have liked. Not his fault at all, just an unfortunate side effect of an otherwise good thing."
236,1,"Great lecturer makes class very enjoyable by giving us time to actually talk with our classmates and get a different opinion. Also has Fun but related side conversations that keep everyone engaged. All in all excellent professor!"
237,1,"Jeremy Grifski teaches in the way that I aspire to teach when I hopefully have a class of my own some day."
238,1,"really cared about the students succeeding"
239,1,"my favorite instructor that i've ever had"
240,1,"Apart from teaching, Jeremy made me take a completely different approach to learning. Instead of focusing on conformity through forced attendance and exam times, Jeremy allowed us to control our learning experience, and allowed me to learn while also focusing on things like career."
241,1,"best prof"
242,1,"I would recommend you to anyone you are an amazing professor and are always helpful in the learning process"
243,1,"Jeremy is a great instructor!"
244,1,"Definitely one of the best instructors I've had especially in the realm of seeming interested in teaching. I think that he made it very clear why the material that he was teaching us was useful and he was also very clear on what material was less useful than the rest. Overall, he understood how the students think and catered to that thinking very well."
245,1,"A great teacher who I will remember for years to come."
246,1,"One of the best teachers I've ever had! Went above and beyond for this course and am incredibly grateful to have had him this semester."
